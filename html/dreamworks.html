            <p>DreamWorks Animation LLC (also simply known as DreamWorks) is an American animation studio that produces animated films and television programs and is a subsidiary of Universal Pictures, a division of NBCUniversal, which is itself a division of Comcast. The studio has released 41 feature films as of July 2021, including several of the highest-grossing animated films of all time, with Shrek 2 (2004) having been the highest at the time of its release. The studio's first film, Antz, was released on October 2, 1998 and its latest film was The Boss Baby: Family Business, which was released on July 2, 2021; their upcoming slate of films include The Bad Guys on April 22, 2022, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish on September 23, 2022, and Trolls 3 on November 17, 2023. Additionally, three untitled films are scheduled to be released on April 7, 2023, February 9, 2024, and September 27, 2024.</p><br>

            <p>Formed as a division of DreamWorks Pictures in 1994 with alumni from Amblin Entertainment's former animation branch Amblimation, it was spun off into a separate company in 2004. NBCUniversal acquired DreamWorks Animation at a cost of $3.8 billion in 2016. The studio originally made some traditionally animated films, as well as two stop-motion co-productions with Aardman Animations, but now exclusively relies on computer animation. Its productions, including The Prince of Egypt, Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and the Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon franchises, have received several accolades, including three Academy Awards, 41 Emmy Awards, numerous Annie Awards, and multiple Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations.</p><br>

            <p>Films produced by DreamWorks Animation were originally distributed by DreamWorks Pictures until 2005, which was then taken over by Paramount Pictures in 2006 until 2012. 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) became the third distributor in 2013 and held the position until 2017. Universal Pictures became the fourth distributor and holds the position since 2019, as well as owning most of the rights to its back catalogue.</p><br>

            <p>reamWorks Animation may be best known for its logo, which is a boy fishing on the moon. The logo originated from DreamWorks Pictures, debuting in 1997. It was later used as the standard logo for DreamWorks Animation from Antz to Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.

            <p>In 2004, DreamWorks unveiled its own logo, in which the boy flies up to the moon via balloons. It originally had music adapted from the track "Fairytale" for the film Shrek (2001), the logo was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, one of the co-composers of Shrek and the composer of the whole Shrek franchise as well as other DreamWorks films. The logo was used from Shrek 2 to Monsters vs. Aliens.</p><br>

            <p>In 2010, DreamWorks unveiled a new logo, this time with the boy fishing on the moon in space. An updated version of the fanfare accompanied this logo, and the logo would be used from How to Train Your Dragon to Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie.</p><br>

            <p>Two years after its acquisition by Universal Pictures in 2016, a new logo was introduced. It is said that it pays homage to the evolution of animation. It received a new fanfare composed by John Powell, the other composer of the first Shrek and other DreamWorks films, adapting some cues from Shrek 2 and some tone from John Williams' fanfare to create the music for the logo. The logo debuted on the first trailer of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World in 2018, but the full animated version and the new fanfare debuted on February 22, 2019, with the release of the film, for which Powell also composed the score. </p><br>
            
            <p>DreamWorks Animation's films are animated at their Glendale campus, but some of their films were animated by Pacific Data Images, a subsidiary of DreamWorks, until its closure in 2015, in a somewhat similar fashion to Illumination, which has most of its films animated by Illumination Mac Guff. Films include Shrek and its sequel, the Madagascar film series, and Megamind. Additionally, DreamWorks occasionally outsources it's animation production to other studios. For example, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie was animated by Mikros Image alongside Technicolor Animation Productions and Spirit Untamed and production assets for The Boss Baby: Family Business were provided by Jellyfish Pictures.</p><br>
            
            <p>DreamWorks Animation has an ongoing partnership with Hewlett-Packard that has been active since 2002, and the studio exclusively uses HP workstations and servers. In 2005, DWA partnered with HP to introduce HP Halo Telepresence Solutions, technologies that allow people in different locations to communicate in a face-to-face environment in real time.
            In 2005, AMD signed a three-year deal to provide Opteron processors to the studio. This relationship ended in 2008, and DreamWorks announced that they would use Intel Xeon processors for all future productions. The same year, both companies announced a technology called InTru3D that allows DreamWorks to produce all of their future films in 3D, beginning with Monsters vs. Aliens.DreamWorks also has a partnership with NetApp in order to supply cloud-based storage that allows the company to complete its films. </p><br>
