                <h1>Animation Styles</h1>
                <p><b>Animation</b> is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation,
                     images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film.
                     Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery. Computer animation can be very detailed 3D 
                     animation, while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time 
                     renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects 
                     like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.</p> <br><br>
                
                <P><b>Traditional animation</b> first appeared more than 140 years ago in 1877, when Emil Reynaud showed the world an apparatus for 
                    demonstrating moving drawings.
                    As the name now suggests, traditional animation means creating each frame manually using a pencil and a piece of paper.
                     Of course, this is a very time-consuming process, but now there are special programs that exponentially simplify the task.
                    The first series of Tom and Jerry cartoons were created manually more than 70 years ago.
        
                    Sometimes you'll hear the opinion that traditional animation is dead, but this is not entirely true. 
                    Traditional animation gave impetus to the development of every other types of animation all of which we will talk
                     about in this article.<br><br></P>
                   
                    
            
                    <p><b>2D animation</b> doesn't need a long introduction or explanation - simply recall the first cartoons produced by 
                    Walt Disney. The uniqueness of 2D animation is that images have only two dimensions - width and height.
                     It is believed that the first animated 2D cartoon was created back in 1906, but the style gained popularity much
                      later, thanks to the work of Walt Disney. At the moment, this is one of the most popular and sought after types 
                      of animation for advertising and promotional videos, explainer videos, and branded cartoons.<br><br></p>
                
                    
                    
                    <p><b>3D animation</b> is synonymous with computer animation since this style arose thanks to the development of computer 
                    graphics and visualization software. The first attempts to create a three-dimensional image were made in 1961, 
                    and the first-ever animated 3D clip appeared in 1972. Here it is.
            
                    Yes, this is just the animated hand of the creator of the video, but it was a major breakthrough in the history 
                    of this style. This video accidentally determined the directions for using 3D animation – for example, medical 
                    imaging.
                    Now, 3D animation is used:
                    
                    -in medicine, to show the work of organs and systems visually or to show the effect of a drug on the body
                    -3d animation in medicine
                    -in architecture to show a building under construction in the most accurate form
                    -in production – for example, Porsche uses 3D models (in combination with augmented reality) to develop unique car designs
                    -in advertising to demonstrate how a product works or how it looks from the inside (such as a complex mechanism)
                    -in full-length cartoons, either for entertainment or marketing.<br><br></p>
                
                    
                    <p><b>Typographic animation</b> or kinetic typography is a style of text animation. The origins of this method go back to 1899 when,
                     an ad containing moving letters was created in France. However, the style became popular only after another 60 years, largely 
                     due to the efforts of Alfred Hitchcock.
                    
                    In business, this style is often used to show statistics or other information in an involving way. This is a good method for 
                    e-learning, as well as for training employees as an alternative to long and boring lectures.
                    Here is an example of how the kinetic typography style may work within the concept of explanation video.<br><br></p>
                
                    
                    <p><b>Motion graphics</b> originated in 1960 and has now become one of the most popular animation techniques in video and content marketing. 
                    In fact, the use of motion design is everywhere – motion graphics production is used to create movie and game screensavers, 
                    commercial advertising, promotional videos, explainer, brand, and storytelling videos. In other words, it’s an almost universal 
                    technique that can solve almost any marketing task.
                    For example, look at the Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell YouTube channel, which uses short videos to explain the most popular 
                    scientific questions.<br><br></p>
                    
                  
                    <p><b>Flipbook Animation</b> is one of the original techniques where each plot element is drawn on separate pages of a notebook. Once the drawing is
                     finished, the pages turn quickly and create a “manual video” due to the quick frame change. In general, flipbook animation is
                      an echo of a praxinoscope – a device for demonstrating moving pictures.
                    Flipbook Animation is not quite suitable for marketing as such but is great for quick storytelling and entertainment for the 
                    target audience.<br><br></p>
                  
                    
                    <p><b>Stop motion animation</b> is one of the most popular, sought after, and old animation techniques. The first attempts to create something similar 
                    to animation using this approach were made more than 150 years ago. In short, the essence of the technique is that the creator 
                    takes several photos by moving objects in the composition. After gluing photos into one track, a continuous video clip is created.
                     The advantage of that approach is that it does not require expensive equipment and facilities.<br><br></p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><b>Mechanical Animation</b> is used to show how a complex device works from the inside out. All the details and mechanisms are drawn with 
                    mathematical precision. Most often, this style is used together with 3D animation to achieve maximum visualization.
                    
                    This technique is very popular in the production of technical equipment because it allows you to make changes to the yet undeveloped 
                    product, significantly saving money on its creation from reducing the likelihood of error. Here’s how it looks. Complemented with a
                     voiceover, a mechanical animation video can make a great explainer video.<br><br></p>
                    
                   
                    <p><b>Animatronics</b> are artificially controlled mechanisms that can take the form of a robot, animal, or any 
                    other non-existent creature. The main idea is that they can be controlled remotely, creating the effect of a “living being”.
                    
                    As with many other techniques, Walt Disney has done a lot to develop this. Here’s how animatronics work at Disneyland entertaining 
                    visitors.<br><br></p>
